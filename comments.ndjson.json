That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. \n\n- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. \n\n- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there.

{"":"186","Video ID":"4AnyhHl3_tE","Comment":"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.\r\n\r\nI bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.\r\n\r\nI didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so \r\nname of the channel is \"Eure Videos Fahrn√ºnftig\"\r\n\r\nGerman Amazon\r\nThiEye CV3-211 https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nAmerican market\r\nJansite https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nNexiGo D80 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CZ5MJ3C\r\n\r\nAustralian & NZ market\r\nVolway https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HBY5KWH","Likes":"21.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

(I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)\n\nFor actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs.","Likes":"24.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.","Likes":"81.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I'm impressed you got a 16\" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)","Likes":"44.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.\n\nEdit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier.

They can be considered parts of extended Rus‚Äô, although their culture was distinct from main Rus‚Äô.\n\nIn 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus‚Äô. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus‚Äô ownership.\n\n‚ÄúRussia‚Äù is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.\n\n\n\n\nGermany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn‚Äôt mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that‚Äôs exactly what ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù did in regards to Rus‚Äô-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!","Likes":"1.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"840","Video ID":"Ccc0GvjuqkQ","Comment":"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.","Likes":"9.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}
