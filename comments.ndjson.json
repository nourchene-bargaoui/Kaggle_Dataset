That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. \n\n- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. \n\n- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there.

Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.\r\n\r\nI bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.\r\n\r\nI didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so \r\nname of the channel is \"Eure Videos Fahrn√ºnftig\"\r\n\r\nGerman Amazon\r\nThiEye CV3-211 https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nAmerican market\r\nJansite https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nNexiGo D80 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CZ5MJ3C\r\n\r\nAustralian & NZ market\r\nVolway https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HBY5KWH","Likes":"21.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

(I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)\n\nFor actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs.","Likes":"24.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.","Likes":"81.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I'm impressed you got a 16\" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)","Likes":"44.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.\n\nEdit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier.

They can be considered parts of extended Rus‚Äô, although their culture was distinct from main Rus‚Äô.\n\nIn 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus‚Äô. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus‚Äô ownership.\n\n‚ÄúRussia‚Äù is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.\n\n\n\n\nGermany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn‚Äôt mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that‚Äôs exactly what ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù did in regards to Rus‚Äô-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!","Likes":"1.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"840","Video ID":"Ccc0GvjuqkQ","Comment":"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.","Likes":"9.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking \"256-bit\" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.

Took up the entire toy budget.\n\nThat happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.\n\nIt was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly.

Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses, this one's just different. The game was over lol. It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards.

Can you believe that?\n\nFor ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes.

{"":"1425","Video ID":"RxhDx1gpoeo","Comment":"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said \"I got bored with the game\".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  \n\nI teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.\n\nI met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.\n\nI also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and \"The Play\" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.\n\nMy own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.\n\nOur team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many \"crazy\" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.\n\nEven in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.\n\nOn my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. üòÇ","Likes":"8.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Just so proud of all of them.\n\nAs for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager.","Likes":"181.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality.

Likely by killing some/many of them, and fish-napping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight. \n\nPeace was plenty possible and Friend figured it out, he just wasn't very smart as shown in the rest of the video. All he had to do was offer them Gruner, at least at that point. \n\nEven at the beginning of the movie, we're set to think he's going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door; but that's the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies.

But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.\nI used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. \nMaking a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. \nOr instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that. \nThanks for the inspiring talk. I'm getting back to work now. Time to review my priority list.","Likes":"967.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.\n2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.\n3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.\n4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.\n5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you.

Yes, figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea, but if the only reason they're helping you is because they're impressed with your selflessness/willingness to risk your life to save hers/they have a connection to the girlfriend, then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game. I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own \"motivations\" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you.","Likes":"287.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"1916","Video ID":"5MgBikgcWnY","Comment":"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the \"SPECIAL KIDS\". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort.

So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.","Likes":"6.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù and the other is ‚Äúunprotected‚Äù. \n\nThe protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. \n\nLithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers don‚Äôt behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. \n\nSo why don‚Äôt people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly.","Likes":"5636.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"2114","Video ID":"K-ssUVyfn5g","Comment":"SUMMARY NOTES:\n00:00 Intro\n-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.\n\n00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?\n- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.\n\n- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. \n\n- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.\n\n- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).\n\n04:56 C (Capture)\n- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.\n\n-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.\n\n- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.\n\n- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.\n\n- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.\n\n08:32 O (Organise)\n- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.\n\n- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.\n\n- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.\n\n- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.\n\n11:07 D (Distill)\n- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.\n\n- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.\n\n- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.\n\n11:45 E (Express)\n-The \"E\" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.\n\n-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.\n\n-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.\n\n13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali\n-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.\n\n-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. \n\n-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.","Likes":"134.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain.

I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.","Likes":"682.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"2270","Video ID":"hkKGjXNQb4I","Comment":"Everybody, you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds. I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun. It would be a cool school science project to do with kids, the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not.","Likes":"109.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church. I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. \n\nOne of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all.","Likes":"3.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Technical analysis can be helpful, but I think It is quite puzzling that well-known cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure T.A and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems. Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous. We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps.

BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP .

I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.","Likes":"462.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made. Many also requested a return claiming the item was defective, but when I paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to Amazons return policies, the item would be returned in perfect working condition. I don‚Äôt know if people are buying suggested items without thinking, or assuming they‚Äôll get something free if they complain, but I can‚Äôt imagine the horror if I had to trash every single return I got. Sometimes, after paying for the return shipping label, the buyer would never ship. All they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup, but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie.","Likes":"212.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I _know_ what \"statelessness\" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous details.\n\nNice work.","Likes":"37.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics, ie what they are and how to execute them. You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one. But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great, pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you want to get really into building, I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials, and once you've gotten to a decently advanced level, watching tutorials from another, far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace - Minecraft. he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft, in my opinion, even better than grian is, though they do build in vastly different ways so there isn't much comparison that works there.","Likes":"13.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

The system is brittle by design, because it's so much cheaper that way.    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.  Instead we've been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home, gutting workforces, funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain / skill loss as the old timers machinists retire, but hey, we delivered a lot of value for shareholders.   And now the chickens are coming home to roost.","Likes":"25.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}
{"":"3219","Video ID":"5_NdbRUNjoY","Comment":"Germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy. Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence. Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable, concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer, but without the emissions. Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclear/fossil fuels. I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants, using the same small plots of land. With Renewable, it requires covering vast amounts of land with solar/wind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is wind/solar. This land should be used for farming or nature preserves, not renewables.  If the solar is using worthless land, such as the desert maybe it makes senses, but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaning/maintenance needed due to the dust. Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem, but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high. Not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties.","Likes":"63.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I‚Äôd like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio. On the downside, nuclear is expensive to build and insure, but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest. There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like we‚Äôll have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts. Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors (4th gen) which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run, making initial investment lower. They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid.","Likes":"42.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Since there wasn't a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created. Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need.\n\nFrom my point of view these things should change:\n- Nuclear is the way to go\n- Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants\n- The western world shouldn't be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability.\n\nFurthermore, the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0% intrest rates, the financial unstable countries (you call them PIGS) Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and with this structural inflation problems. Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time.\n\nLast but not least, the EU but also the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE, start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years... if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable.\n\nThanks again Marko","Likes":"5.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

All transactions that have ever occurred since Bitcoin's inception is permanently recorded on the public world-wide ledger.

Lawsuits are not fun in any way (unless your the attorney/firm) and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress. My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always.\n\nMoreover, if the other side has an attorney, they have the advantage of knowing how the system works, such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase (Rule 26a dislcosures, interrogatories, evidence you intend to use at trial, depositions of plaintiffs, defendants, and expert witnesses, etc.) and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge. \n\nI truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself. Just be careful with how you proceed. Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done. Also remember it's a legal system and not a justice system. \n\nThis is not legal advice, just a concerned fan. Lawyers or other legal professionals, please correct anything I may have overlooked/unintentionally misconstrued. \n\nP.S. I think the service (the guy who threw the papers at you rudely) was fine, unfortunately. You identified yourself. Once that happens, they can just leave it at your doorstep.","Likes":"23.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms‚Äô liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you‚Äôre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don‚Äôt have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions.

You've reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too\". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldn‚Äôt be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you can‚Äôt time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesn‚Äôt matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy.

Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out. Next bull run it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & i need this lower point to get back in, i've small cash on the sideline I don't like that but i refuse to fomo in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advise to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore. With her guides and trade signal i use in trading, i have moved from having 5.8 btc to atop 17.3 btc in a short period of time. Invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader.

Congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins. Good luck. Bitcoin price recently completed a two-month surge that resulted in a price increase to over $25,000; consequently, investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs next target price. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms‚Äô liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you‚Äôre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don‚Äôt have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with and trade with my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore trade signal and the rest will be a good history of profits for you.

{"":"3698","Video ID":"mLXELbuQNQQ","Comment":"< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with *WTRADE INSPECTS* , in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.","Likes":"0.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.

I've been following for months now and the cinematic videos, excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding. Before anything else, I would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go, but we can try to make predictions using past events, I think prices should run up a lot now, punishing panic sellers and forced sellers. Most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish. Many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses, slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as. Everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective. Everything has changed‚Ä¶we are in a recession, facing stagflation, rising rates, and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof, breaking consumers‚Äô backs. <There are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market, smart investors trade and take short-term profits. I've made over 11‚Äô BTC with 2.1‚Äô BTC retail trading, not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market, Kyle Miller, I came across his channel where he shares his charts. <The selling fatigue will wane, and the market will reset.

{"":"3833","Video ID":"Q6D14KkvK3o","Comment":"I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, I‚Äôve small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mr.Kyle Miller. With his guides and the trade signal, I use in trading, I have moved from having 5.8 BTC to atop 17.3 BTC in a short period of time.

Do traders convert BTC into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and \"buy back\" by converting back into BTC? is this what people do? also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes? thank you for any advice, all the best, Kieron","Likes":"2.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down, just like stocks are not done going down. And if this isn‚Äôt a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now. Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO. Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions.

Non-cubers often consider a cube \"broken\" if it's popped or corner-twisted - I remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin corner-twisted it.\n\nThat comes at the expense of having almost no corner-cutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn., but then again it's not meant to be their Speedcube (the Rubik's brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though, but for different reasons).","Likes":"7.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

{"":"4383","Video ID":"7Ron6MN45LY","Comment":"How To Solve the Rubik's Cube FASTER ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmeleO65BHc\n\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING.\n\nI try to reply often, but \"I don't get step X\" or \"it doesn't work\" is too unspecific and I can't help unless I know exactly what problem you have.\n\n\n*MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES*\n1:52 has the 4 moves, and you have to be able to do this to understand what \"4 moves\" means when I use it again later on.\n\n*COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS*\nStep 1 & 2. If the side colors of the cross or first layer don't line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don't just pick white pieces randomly. I talk about this in the video, how I'm trying to match the other colors of the white piece (like white/orange etc.)\n\n*TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER*\nStep 3. At 5:33 I say \"you should already know how to do this\". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.\n\n*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*\nStep 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\nStep 5. There should be no problems here.\nStep 6. If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\nStep 7. Finish the 4 moves (don't stop at 3) every time. Turn the bottom (don't rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.\n\n\"Why do I need to reassemble the cube?\"\nRandomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable. If you've ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces, then that can be the problem. If stickers have been switched, you will have to switch them back.\n\nFull example solve: https://youtu.be/DepFQpJ5KqU","Likes":"7589.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

We should be doing everything possible to broaden chess's appeal, garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity, and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process.

That would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateur-like play.  This might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke, but I suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the NBA or NFL or MLB, some persons would be calling for an investigation.  Just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the Carlsen -Firouzja match.  (Note how strangely Carlsen played in game four, was it?, of his match with Pragg.)  I don't know how much Las Vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess, but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy.

And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely. He couldn't even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested. The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.","Likes":"53.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I stagnated between 600-700 until August, so I decided to learn more from you, consequently I start winning and 0-blunder games started to be a habit around November. In December I reached 900 and after now I am finally at the 4-digit mark. Thank you Levy! You're such a great teacher!","Likes":"770.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

In an esport I follow, (Age of Empires 2) one player (TheViper) was so dominant for so long that a streamer (T90Official) came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyone's identities were hidden and only revealed at the end. Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who. Was a really interesting concept, as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who. They've repeated the format 4 times now, which says something about how loved it is. But with chess being an online thing now, this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating. Would Magnus still win? (TheViper did, so proved that theory wrong at least for him!)","Likes":"249.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"4855","Video ID":"Od3gG13tyf8","Comment":"My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey. They played on the same team in inter-state tournaments. I found some of my Grandpa‚Äôs old letters and it‚Äôs pretty cool. He won multiple chess championships (some amateur and some professional) in the late 40s and early 50s. He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines. He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year, it‚Äôs likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa. My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially (chess tournaments didn‚Äôt pay well back then). Though, he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future. If a 13 year old made a multi-time champion quit the game entirely, he must have been truly special. My grandpa could card count so I don‚Äôt think he had a problem switching to bridge, and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career. I never got to meet him because he died before I was born (I‚Äôm only 23), I would‚Äôve loved to ask him about Bobby. Maybe my mom knows a bit more. All I have are letters and a few chess trophies.

Lashing out comes from difficulty communicating, feeling different and knowing you are different, it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight. Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess. While playing he probably felt safe, knowing the rules, knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didn't understand or care about.","Likes":"79.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

The iPad release along with a new Mac pro computer will come in October. It will be strange getting iOS watchOS and tvOS updates but no iPad out West on the same day. It is called confusion. Apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen. I‚Äôd like Apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame. Hopefully I was 16 and watchOS along with tvOS will be released on Monday, September 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work. I do not like getting updates while I am at work because it will take time to install them. I did watch YouTube video from a different channel and I replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iPhone 8 would not be compatible with iOS 17 in 2023. Do you think this is true? If so, should my parents who have iPhone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before I was 17 comes out? Out?

I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well. \nI also see no reason for anyone to upgrade. I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers. I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way. If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line, I would say if you have an 11pro, any 12, or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade. IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything. Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time. \nThe watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb. If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around $280-$340 brand or refurbished from apple. Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6. \nI think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip.\nThe product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad. Getting way better features. I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since it‚Äôll have usb-c. I wish they would do the same with the iphone, airpods & apple pencil. \nI cant wait for the October event.

It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC ü§î? I feel that the argument that many people don‚Äôt use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), it‚Äôs more or less well-rounded. However, if I‚Äôm bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldn‚Äôt be that far off from the M1 Pro 14‚Äù MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14‚Äù would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13‚Äù non-retina MacBook Pro üòÖ. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty that‚Äôs losing it‚Äôs veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. I‚Äôm hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. It‚Äôs an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that I‚Äôve yet to experience. At work, I work with desktop towers and I‚Äôm used to the noise, I suppose.","Likes":"2.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.\n\nTo keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.\nTo keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.\n\nGreat videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.\n\n>> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other.

The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that.

{"":"5438","Video ID":"xvNvj7ku5pY","Comment":"I am not convinced. I have done some digging into AI myself, genetic algorithms  and such. From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables, x, y, z, etc. It then changes part of the function, via constants to achieve the goal. If it doesn't match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an AI and a basic algebraic function. Y = X would then technically be a sentient being by that definition.\n\nFinally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an AI the ability to feel pain, sorrow, longing, grief, greed, and the like is terribly inhumane.\n\nA super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans.\n\nI mean just because the AI can out strategize doesn't mean I am going to give it the nuclear launch codes.","Likes":"10.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

When i was around 7/8 i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc., me and older brother (and in that day my cousins) were playing with the underwater firearm (more a aquatic arch, don't know the exact english name, not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it) seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats, when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving (really big and to this day never saw something like that, especially in the docs). The most scary part it was, when we were chasing the fish (so my brother could shoot), we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface. It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help. It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one. From that day on i'm scared to go fishing. Not kidding.

With our current understanding, it seems likely that we'll either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isn't; or, on the other hand, make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it, perhaps for a very long time. The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me. True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe; but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance....

But, humans being expansionist by nature and training the A.I. on our own speech and texts, it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the A.I. slowly but surely. I hope the A.I. deems it ethically right to work along side it's creators and expand in co-op in the future when it does become senteint. Not only this but once the A.I. becomes self-aware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the A.I. and who gets to use it and for what. Because A.I. is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly.","Likes":"34.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I feel that sites that focus on one topic/area of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point - but the guidelines although detailed in places, are still pretty vague. \n\nThe data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully.","Likes":"3.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}
{"":"5642","Video ID":"u987sQrDsSM","Comment":"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure \"helpful.\" I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top. The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled.  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. \n\nContent farms have high production value and low value content, but users will go first for slick looking.  And the kicker, Google generates revenue from ads on those pages. Put simply, incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content.\n\nEdit: Not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric.  Apply that idea to getting a mortgage, getting medical advice, hiring a contractor,...  If someone tells me fertilzer X-Y-Z is best for my tomatoes, you know what I'm going to do.","Likes":"15.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I think that they still track you, and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it, and I believe this is also the case for other security features.

Only our plans were thwarted, because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor, and it was moving really really slowly in front of us.

For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It's unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it's a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory. Like my husband's parents, they always have a large jug of water in their car, along with a week's worth of rations, First Aid Kit, blankets, flares, etc, even though they rarely go off the beaten path.","Likes":"1980.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. \n\nI have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he...

So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!\n\nTo all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning.

My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers. Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions. The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didn't really work. Now I start by saying what I am doing currently, the job or education I did before this, a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experience/skills.  \"I am 26 years old, currently a team coordinator at ___. Before this I was studying __ and volunteering at ___. I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector!\" \nI don't know why but I always start with my age üòÖ\n\nAfter this they usually ask why you want the position.

The documentary seemed relevant to this. This historian pointed out that each and every one of us likes to imagine that if we had been present at some dark moment in history, we would have been the ones to stand up, think independently and rebel. And yet, almost no one (if anyone at all) did this at these times. If you have grown up with everyone around you--parents, mentors, peers, teachers, leaders--all thinking one way, it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own. It seems that in a very significant way, we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born. Whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think, that is what you will be for the rest of your life. Unless you are one out of a million. From what this guy says, it is no surprise at all that he became what he became. We can never excuse terrible crimes, but we can try to understand them.","Likes":"121.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I was like..... surprised inside, but outside stayed calm because that's important. I get why they're asking, but I'm like, lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured? Who knows how I did. I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead. I'm in the USA if you didn't already guess that. 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up -- and no, they weren't security jobs. I don't even care, really.

Fresh out of college as an engineer, I did great during a phone interview, but poorly in a face-to-face invterview for a fortune 500 company. I just didn't have pre-planned topics to answer some questions with and came off as unprepared and inexperienced. I didn't get the job then. 5 years later,  I wanted to redeem myself. This was a once in a lifetime job opportunity for me so I didn't want to miss my chance. I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely. I nailed it. I started by highlighting key aspects of the job posting, and then I thought about all of these interview questions and practiced my responses daily until they came out naturally. It landed me the job!","Likes":"51.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I‚Äôm a right leaning guy politically as well. I loved this interview. I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation, exclude them. But Emma‚Äôs approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didn‚Äôt know they had. Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together, when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved. When I say compromise I don‚Äôt mean Women or Men not achieving full equality. I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side. When one person yells at another, the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back.

{"":"6198","Video ID":"TtGEf_3xhA4","Comment":"I agree with the Serma's comments regarding Casemiro's age, but this whole \"30 is the new 25\" is very subjective and depends on the player. Luckily, Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well, and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats. His injury record is phenomenal as well. However, not every player ages like Casemiro, Modric, Ronaldo, etc. Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30. So, whereas it's objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way, that doesn't mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it (some don't even have the opportunity to do so). Players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Busquets, are good examples of the counter-narrative in my opinion. On his goals, Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the opposition's box is very good - great aerial ability as well. All in all, Real should be glad that they didn't lose him without Tchouameni already recruited. Good luck Tank!","Likes":"19.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"6337","Video ID":"dDzp4YXpzLk","Comment":"I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.","Likes":"25.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

Pure Doraces people exist no more.\n\nI read in a book titled Hurakan, that the first Spanish that came to the Panamanian Isthmus were surprised and terrified of finding mountains of skeletons of persons piled up.","Likes":"14.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"6463","Video ID":"ZBDLEROHj9E","Comment":"My grandmother was born in 1944. She was the youngest of five children. The village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory, so the EAM/ELAS forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anti-communist activity. Her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply co-operate with the communists. Then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anti-communist activity. The whole family (my grandmother being just a few months old) was transported to a prison camp set up by the EAM/ELAS for anyone accused of opposing them. There, they rounded up all the men and executed them. My great-grandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well. Soon, the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes. My grandmother grew up without a father, something which still deeply affects her to this day. Because of that, she simply dismisses anything remotely left-wing because of all the trauma caused by EAM/ELAS.

{"":"6508","Video ID":"IV3dnLzthDA","Comment":"Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity. But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10,000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period. Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead, many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib. Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment. So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels. To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view.","Likes":"81.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites. They crossed over the seas from Jerusalem around 600 BC and landed on what they described to be  a narrow neck of land (most likely in Panama). They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new \"Promised land\".

{"":"6580","Video ID":"ExvEIOWB-H0","Comment":"So there's been some conversations here about my use of the term 'Viking' and who it refers to. I think it's important to start off by saying that these videos aren't made for university-level history buffs or the like. They're designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams (A-Levels, GCSEs etc.). Since I base my videos (where applicable) on British teaching standards I think it's important to note that that the use of the term 'Viking' and 'Scandinavian' are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level. At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree, absolutely not. That level of historical nuance isn't required here.\n\nYes, the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances. But not here. These videos aren't for in-depth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age.  The people commenting that 'Viking' was not used accurately are largely correct. However, in the context of who this video is for, it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities. These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further. There are other channels if you'd like in-depth and dry discussions of terminology.\n\nAnyway, I hope you all enjoyed the video.","Likes":"1528.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"6652","Video ID":"dW_ekZRGalk","Comment":"My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan (which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years) in the Guangdong Province. Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. \nSome years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children \"why do all of you not love China?!\" and they would retort \"if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?\" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.\nI asked my Grandmother once \"do you think Mao Zedong is good?\" and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation \"Yes! Yes, he's wonderful!\" and started blurting out the first few phrases of the Chinese national anthem in song. I guess it's why that generation is called the \"Lost Generation.\"","Likes":"463.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

His stepmother and aunt Hatshepsut became regent during his minority but was herself declared pharaoh within a couple of years. Although Thutmose III was not deposed, he would remain powerless during Hatshepsut's reign. In theory he and his stepmother were co-rulers, but in practice his position was nebulous and he was kept out of the way as Hatshepsut ruled Egypt. Thutmose III was also married to Hatshepsut's daughter to further consolidate his claim to the throne. Its believed that Thutmose III resented Hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first 22 years of his reign, and after Hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures.\n\nThutmose III was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunt's tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning. At this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory. All the while Egypt under Hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security, which the nation needed. Trade routes were re-established and the economy grew by leaps and bounds.

{"":"6753","Video ID":"j4kI2h3iotA","Comment":"As someone who studies convict leasing in Tennessee, this is a great video. Just a couple corrections:\n1. Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham. They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (it's a little more complicated than that, but we can go with that for simplicity's sake) who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee. After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896, Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there, but those were Alabama prisoners, NOT Tennessee prisoners. \n2. States absolutely used convict leasing to make money. The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than $100,000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid-1880s. That would be over $2 million per year in today's money. \n3. Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers. The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner. They would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didn't know, and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses. Hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal.\n\nI am happy to provide archival documents for these facts if you are interested.","Likes":"206.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"6856","Video ID":"zNEpojtXotE","Comment":"'The sorrows of young werther' is a fabulous book, despite the tragic-romantic style. It is not only based on Goethe's own disappointing experiences with women, but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him.\nI'm no expert on Goethe but I also understand he completed the colour wheel which Isaac Newton started.\nIt is important to understand that in Goethe's time there was a 'Romantic movement'; nothing to do with the definition of the word today, but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment. Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called 'Sturm und Drang' (Storm and Stress), a small group including Schiller, of 'angry young men' who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement.\nBy the way, if you haven't done a video on the Romantic movement please do.\nThe Romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment, such as science and rationalism, and its clinical, dry, detached way of categorising humanity and the world.\nThe Romantics were not an organised group as such. One of the best descriptions of (the Romantics) was written by my old Philosophy teacher - \"The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of 'culture' and 'rationality' which barred the way, both historically and personally, to a \"return to nature\": this is nature the unbounded, wild and ever-changing, nature the sublime and powerful. Were humans to behave 'Naturally', freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality, then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed, and humans could live a nobler life. In the name of nature, the romantics worshipped: liberty, power, love, violence, imagination, irrationality, the Greeks, the 'primitives' or anything that aroused their emotional responses, while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves.\"","Likes":"43.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors.

{"":"6902","Video ID":"Lr6DYLBkyG0","Comment":"I think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself  in your \"death \nbed\" every now and then . To prepare yourself for this,  you must read \nthe 9th chapter of \" The Death of Ivan Ilyich\"  again. Just a very short\n chapter where Ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed.  He \nsuddenly  hears the voice of his own soul saying:\n-What do you want? What do you want?\nHe says:\n\n-What do I want? To live and not to suffer.\n\nSo his inner voice says:\n\n- To live? How?\n\n- To live as I used to- well and pleasantly. \n\n- As you lived before, well and pleasantly?\n\nHere is how Tolstoy continues:\n\n\" And in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant\n life. But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant \nlife now seemed at all what they had then seemed_ none of them except \nthe first recollections of childhood. There , in childhood, there had \nbeen something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live \nif it could return. But the child who had experienced that happiness \nexisted no longer: it was like a reminiscence of somebody else. \nAs soon as the period began which had produced the present Ivan Ilyich, \nall that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned \ninto something trivial and often nasty\".\n\nSo as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and \ndarker.  He basically realises that his entire life had been a lie, he \nlived for what the others expected from him; for money, power and status...He wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no\n way back!\n\nIndeed we all must keep Ivan Ilyich in mind every day. Just consider how\n fast the time goes by.... How much of it do we really spend seriously \nthinking about our lives? Very little indeed... Because it requires a \ncertain level of focus and depth, which we don't have most of the time.\nThat's why this scene is a great reminder. \n\nSo as we make the \"Death bed  exercise\" I have just mentioned, we can \nuse the very questions that Ivan Ilyich's soul was asking him.\nI think people who live well, deal with their mortality better. So doing\n this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better.\n\nThank you for this wonderful lesson. I love Tolstoy!","Likes":"1174.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

It's usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways.

I once asked him how he did it and he replied: \"Don't think too much. Just let the book take you away. If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading, that's when you'll read slowly and with a more analytical eye. But not every book will be worth it. And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it, so no point in forcing it.\"\nI kinda get it, because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it. At the end of the book I understood what it was about, even though I didn't get everything. But I just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything, and get everything right the first time. (Hello perfectionism, my old friend)\nWhen I read a piece of high literature, or a history/philosophy book, I have to read and reread a paragraph until I feel like I got it. I never enjoy the ride, and that's why I've been reading less.\nThis video is a good reminder to just turn off and let the book carry you.

Most readers don't do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things they've read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them.  Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection.  And in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose, re-reading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same, if you pick it up again after a few years, you're a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way.","Likes":"92.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a \"difficult book\", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a \"light reading\" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail. But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it _incredible_, since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed.

It took me three or four goes to get through it first time round, but every time I started from the beginning again, I was finding new stuff in it I hadn't noticed before - and in the end taught myself enough German to be able to tackle it in the original.

{"":"7026","Video ID":"LAzKGkTIKpg","Comment":"Some of my favorite Voltaire quotes (this man was a genius!):\n\n\"Being a bird ain't all about flying and shitting from high places.\"\n\n\"It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear. It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It takes an instant to kill him.\"\n\n\"Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.\"\n\n\"Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.\"\n\n\"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.\"\n\n\"If you have two religions in your land, the two will cut each other‚Äôs throats; but if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace.\"\n\n\"What can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying God rather than men, and that as a result he's certain he'll go to heaven if he cuts your throat?\"\n\n\"Behind every successful man stands a surprised mother-in-law.\"\n\n \"It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge.\"\n\n\"Animals have these advantages over man: they never hear the clock strike, they die without any idea of death, they have no theologians to instruct them, their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies, their funerals cost them nothing, and no one starts lawsuits over their wills.\"\n\n\"The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.\"\n\n\"Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.\"\n\n\"Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time.\"\n\n\"Despite the enormous quantity of books, how few people read! And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day.\"\n\n\"I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities, for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one‚Äôs very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?\"\n\n\"Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.\"\n\n\"The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.\"\n\n\"It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.\"\n\n\"God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh.\"","Likes":"246.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important, moreover sufficient. If you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 3-5 studies, try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph.

It is correct that we can break a literature review down to structural components. But the modern students who I teach (there are 500 on my university of York dissertation module), are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge, and the fields of literature become endless. The student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order. I find examples help, so students can see the limits and horizons before them. My students asked me to post examples up, so this is what I did on my channel, it was originally intended for my own students, but there are now there for all to see.

{"":"7095","Video ID":"IskEx0tgoo4","Comment":"This was a lovely event, worth it for the acting alone, especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of Eve's awakening.\n\nI do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeare's terms and turf, in part because Prof. Smith politely allowed it to stay there. Some thoughts:\n- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.\n- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.\n- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.\n\nIn short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place.","Likes":"24.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"7133","Video ID":"UI9I2p71ct0","Comment":"Magical realism is not from Colombia because the term is European in concoction. However, when European writers viewed the way Latin American writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of \"magical\". They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification, without realising that it's ALL real and that it's a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies. If we think about what exotification is, it's about seeing what's mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it. It's very much about ignorance and how what we don't understand can often appear magical. As a result, how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered. This is why magical realism, in my opinion, does not exist. It's a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre.","Likes":"43.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes.

This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method. Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space.

But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesn‚Äôt prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?\n\nWell, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It‚Äôs not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you‚Äôre going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.\n\nNow the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics ¬†into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, it‚Äôs a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again. ¬†You see what I‚Äôm saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea.","Likes":"445.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

{"":"7471","Video ID":"WQkl1utfHVM","Comment":"Good summation. My only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in Jan 21 because it was highly shorted.\n My understanding is it's part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument (and all retail companies. Movie theatre, used game store, towels) and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket. I can't talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21. \nSure, since becoming bagholders people think it's a movement but to start with it was a value play. When I went long gme was $9.18 pre split with $12 book value. When I went long bbby it was $4.98 with huge call option interest at $5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game. \nIt's fine playing meme stocks but I suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if Ryan Cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his üòâ","Likes":"5.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Some asmrtists, as fine as they are, do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners. There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don't realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos.

I think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that I remember was a burger from Spain and a Stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands. I don't remember trying the Spanish burger, it really wasn't anything that different. The Stroopwafel McFlurry was awesome tho, was sad to see it go. Anyway, I knew a little bit about the Japanese exclusive items, and was hopeful they'd continue it and do a run with a few of those here, the McTeriyaki Burger sounds awesome, and I'm surprised they haven't tried the McFloats here. Ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the US and it would be so easy. A Dr Pepper McFloat would be really good for US taste. I'm also kind of upset they ditched the Snack Wraps, probably a US exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around. They had 3 that I remember, Big Mac, a barbecue crispy chicken one, and I think a bacon ranch one (?) wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito. I think you got 2 per order, and They were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if that's what one was hungry for on the go.","Likes":"55.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I really hope that after Gordon leaves that Dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves. To be completely honest, the cook showed promise, but he didn't show up half of the time when he needed to and didn't listen to Dean and wants to say Dean is a bad man...that's ridiculous. Dean put up with Orelio (cook/chef) thinking he can do what he wants (mainly Dean's own fault) and so now that is what he expects.

{"":"9348","Video ID":"v514hwoC_fY","Comment":"I'm going to comment this on every potato video:  To simplify the de-starching of your potato, whether it's for chips, fries, hash browns, or whatever, use a solid-bottom salad spinner.  Fill it with water, swish your potato pieces, lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until it's clear.  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes.  You will get them super dry in just a minute.  Then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel, but this will save you paper towels, because they will be dry.\nOf course, there is no reason you _must_ use my technique.  After all, you are the Johnny Depp, of your Potato Prep.  Enjoy!","Likes":"583.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal‚Ä¶ HALO-HALO!‚Ä¶ Are you kidding me filipinos!? That is crack cocaine in dessert form! And everything else! All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro! \n\nI love my Mexican food and while I wouldn‚Äôt ever trade it for anything, filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion.","Likes":"1615.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}
