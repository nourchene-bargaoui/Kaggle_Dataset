That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. \n\n- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. \n\n- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there.

Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.\r\n\r\nI bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.\r\n\r\nI didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so \r\nname of the channel is \"Eure Videos Fahrn√ºnftig\"\r\n\r\nGerman Amazon\r\nThiEye CV3-211 https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nAmerican market\r\nJansite https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08DCWG1K5\r\n\r\nNexiGo D80 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CZ5MJ3C\r\n\r\nAustralian & NZ market\r\nVolway https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HBY5KWH","Likes":"21.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

(I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)\n\nFor actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs.","Likes":"24.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.","Likes":"81.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I'm impressed you got a 16\" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)","Likes":"44.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.\n\nEdit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier.

They can be considered parts of extended Rus‚Äô, although their culture was distinct from main Rus‚Äô.\n\nIn 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus‚Äô. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus‚Äô ownership.\n\n‚ÄúRussia‚Äù is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.\n\n\n\n\nGermany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn‚Äôt mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that‚Äôs exactly what ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù did in regards to Rus‚Äô-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!","Likes":"1.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"840","Video ID":"Ccc0GvjuqkQ","Comment":"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.","Likes":"9.0","Sentiment":"0.0"}

I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking \"256-bit\" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.

Took up the entire toy budget.\n\nThat happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.\n\nIt was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly.

Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses, this one's just different. The game was over lol. It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards.

Can you believe that?\n\nFor ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes.

{"":"1425","Video ID":"RxhDx1gpoeo","Comment":"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said \"I got bored with the game\".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  \n\nI teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.\n\nI met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.\n\nI also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and \"The Play\" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.\n\nMy own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.\n\nOur team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many \"crazy\" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.\n\nEven in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.\n\nOn my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. üòÇ","Likes":"8.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Just so proud of all of them.\n\nAs for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager.","Likes":"181.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality.

Likely by killing some/many of them, and fish-napping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight. \n\nPeace was plenty possible and Friend figured it out, he just wasn't very smart as shown in the rest of the video. All he had to do was offer them Gruner, at least at that point. \n\nEven at the beginning of the movie, we're set to think he's going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door; but that's the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies.

But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.\nI used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. \nMaking a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. \nOr instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that. \nThanks for the inspiring talk. I'm getting back to work now. Time to review my priority list.","Likes":"967.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.\n2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.\n3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.\n4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.\n5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you.

Yes, figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea, but if the only reason they're helping you is because they're impressed with your selflessness/willingness to risk your life to save hers/they have a connection to the girlfriend, then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game. I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own \"motivations\" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you.","Likes":"287.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

{"":"1916","Video ID":"5MgBikgcWnY","Comment":"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the \"SPECIAL KIDS\". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort.

So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.","Likes":"6.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù and the other is ‚Äúunprotected‚Äù. \n\nThe protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. \n\nLithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers don‚Äôt behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. \n\nSo why don‚Äôt people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly.","Likes":"5636.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"2114","Video ID":"K-ssUVyfn5g","Comment":"SUMMARY NOTES:\n00:00 Intro\n-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.\n\n-The \"second brain\" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.\n\n00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?\n- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.\n\n- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. \n\n- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.\n\n- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).\n\n04:56 C (Capture)\n- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.\n\n-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.\n\n- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.\n\n- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.\n\n- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.\n\n08:32 O (Organise)\n- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.\n\n- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.\n\n- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.\n\n- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.\n\n11:07 D (Distill)\n- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.\n\n- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.\n\n- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.\n\n11:45 E (Express)\n-The \"E\" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.\n\n-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.\n\n-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.\n\n13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali\n-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.\n\n-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. \n\n-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.","Likes":"134.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain.

I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.","Likes":"682.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

{"":"2270","Video ID":"hkKGjXNQb4I","Comment":"Everybody, you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds. I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun. It would be a cool school science project to do with kids, the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not.","Likes":"109.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church. I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. \n\nOne of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all.","Likes":"3.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Technical analysis can be helpful, but I think It is quite puzzling that well-known cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure T.A and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems. Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous. We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps.

BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP .

I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.","Likes":"462.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made. Many also requested a return claiming the item was defective, but when I paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to Amazons return policies, the item would be returned in perfect working condition. I don‚Äôt know if people are buying suggested items without thinking, or assuming they‚Äôll get something free if they complain, but I can‚Äôt imagine the horror if I had to trash every single return I got. Sometimes, after paying for the return shipping label, the buyer would never ship. All they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup, but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie.","Likes":"212.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}

One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I _know_ what \"statelessness\" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous details.\n\nNice work.","Likes":"37.0","Sentiment":"2.0"}

Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics, ie what they are and how to execute them. You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one. But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great, pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you want to get really into building, I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials, and once you've gotten to a decently advanced level, watching tutorials from another, far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace - Minecraft. he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft, in my opinion, even better than grian is, though they do build in vastly different ways so there isn't much comparison that works there.","Likes":"13.0","Sentiment":"1.0"}
