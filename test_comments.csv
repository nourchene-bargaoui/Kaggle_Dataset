Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it's been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are """"scientific"""" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics.

I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world. At my university, computer engineering was 85% computer science, 15% electrical/electronics engineering. It's functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned. I chose to take robotics electives in school but don't actually use those skills in my job. I'm just a standard software developer/engineer. Haha.";;

I'd definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer graphics, game development, distributed systems, and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry you're interested in."",281.0,2.0";;

1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.;;
;;
2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.;;

"3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an """"off"""" state at 0 volts.

Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All Iâ€™m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesnâ€™t know how to code, and donâ€™t think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it elseâ€™s, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay thatâ€™s loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  Iâ€™m still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please donâ€™t, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier."",646.0,2.0";;

Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look"""").

O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Î©(n) (pronounced """"big-omega"""") is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Î˜(n), prounounced """"theta"""" (without the """"big"""") is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.";;
;;
Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is Î˜(n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.;;

"You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have Î©(n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values.

14902,-Zj1kepwRuw,I've been stuck in tutorial hell for so long. At the moment I can code any mockup in HTML and CSS and Javascript is a challenge. I deleted every tutorial on my PC and decided to take this course. Week 0 blew my mind. The problem solving approach is what I love. It teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own.,518.0,2.0;;
"14903,-Zj1kepwRuw,""Strongly Agree... ";;
When I started my journey as a programmer. CS50 was my first course and I learned everything online from Net Ninja tutorials, W3schools, Clever Programmers, and so on.;;

14905,-Zj1kepwRuw,I totally agree with him. Before joining this course I couldn't even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious. But I attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest. So if you want to learn Python or Web or AI or CS  basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try. It's worth it.,47.0,2.0;;
"14906,-Zj1kepwRuw,""Yes, this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding. For anyone that's getting deeper into learning web dev stuff, I highly recommend Scrimba. It has a great problem-solving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what you've learned together instead of just showing you the solution first. There's also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it's very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor. You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code that's being written during the tutorial."",17.0,2.0";;

"14914,z3o6yEzcnLc,""I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just """"programming"""" or """"software engineering"""". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving";" developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into."",284.0,0.0";

Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing on the day to day.

I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldn't handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter.

"15530,mxjMX7ziMNc,""Console exclusives aren't going anywhere. They would be insane to split market share off of their hardware, their ecosystem and ultimately their control.

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.;;

15546,sN9kJY3Ie4s,What would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then?  We might as well have a one console nation.   No competition or reasons to buy different consoles.   Exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console.  Thereâ€™s a reason Netflix has different movies from HBO Max.,24.0,1.0;;
15547,sN9kJY3Ie4s,I believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives. Companies like Nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms.,73.0,1.0;;

You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost (including Xbox and Xbox 360 games) so there's that too. Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS.

Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.

Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).

I few years back, I did a repair on a computer with a broken SATA port.  i replaced the port and the system ran fine.  A year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasn't working.  I'm like 'okay'.  I asked did he want data recover service.  He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something I'd done.  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders.  I said to him that his system didn't even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it.  He mumbled something and said he'd just take his business elsewhere.;;

"I know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists.  But I have a serious question to people who'd just be regular customers.  If you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem, would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free?  I'm hoping this question doesn't come out as snarky or sarcastic.  It's a sincere question I'd like to have answered."",6.0,1.0";;

"15774,JzjkmhcpYYU,""I think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially, when you look at the number of studios Microsoft has been acquiring, and with fewer cross gen titles limiting Devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles."",210.0,2.0";;
"15775,JzjkmhcpYYU,""Iâ€™m very happy with my Series S, and Iâ€™ve been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but Iâ€™ve just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didnâ€™t really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, Iâ€™ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, Iâ€™ll get one but for now Iâ€™m really enjoying my Series S"",160.0,2.0";;
15776,JzjkmhcpYYU,As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,50.0,2.0;;
"15777,JzjkmhcpYYU,""I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. Itâ€™ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. Thereâ€™s a lot that goes into this stuff. ";;
;;
Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. Iâ€™ll be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then Iâ€™m 200% sure Iâ€™ll feel justified with the purchase.;;

"Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a secondâ€¦ I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that canâ€™t even keep up with my old 4K tv."",44.0,2.0";;

"15781,JzjkmhcpYYU,""I don't have a Series X yet, and although Series S is a great console, the fact is all digital is a no go for me.

So the only way of playing those games is using the disc. I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive, but as this is not an option, I'll have to go with the Series X.";;
"Another point is that, although GamePass is great (I had it for two years and experienced great games, including Halo Infinite), I think it is a bit too expensive. If it was $80 per year, as the Live Gold was, it would be a no brainer, but at $15 per month ($180 per year) I think it is too expensive.

Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadn't turned on my series X for a week. And before that it was just sporadically. So decided to sell.  BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.

But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get. And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry???? ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨ Talk about the pot calling the kettle black ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤£ Sony has no answer to gamepass, there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they can't go anywhere else. This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD. But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat, and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldn't leave COD multiplatform.

"15932,6lbJ55D7rKg,""IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)"",12.0,2.0";;

Bring in Alpha Flight and at the end have a cut scene of Heather and James on a hunting trip and encountering a wild beast in the woods. They don't even have to show his face, not revealing who the actor is. This could lunch into the X-men Movie where Xavier is  recruiting the new team to battle Karoka to rescue the original team. They could do flash backs for the first half giving us the true original roster. I always fear that the X-men movie will feature the more popular members rather than establishing the original 5 and later Havok and Polaris. I don't mind having the most popular members, but stay true to the originals. Hated when Fox screwed it all up. And Rogue WAS A VILLIAN before joining the X-men."",29.0,1.0";;

You hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation.

As the figure gets closer, it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury, looking pretty grizzled after his time in space. Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar. She tells him that sheâ€™s been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years. Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back. â€œThis is different,â€ he says. ;;

In a montage, we get quick glimpses of Talos encountering a group of evil Skulls, Emilia Clarke shooting a gun, Kingsley Ben-Adir multiplying into several identical forms in a confrontation with Fury, and Olivia Colman talking to Nick Fury saying â€œYouâ€™re in no shape for this Fury.â€ We also see Rhodey being questioned about his security detail and a shot of Martin Freeman as Agent Everett K.

He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him, but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter, Cassie. As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds, Scottâ€™s phone rings, and the caller ID tells him that itâ€™s the SFPD, leading him to remark aloud, â€œWhy is jail calling?â€;;
;;
After Scott bails his daughter, Cassie Lang, out of jail, they are seen eating dinner with the Pym/van Dyneâ€™s (Hope, Hank, and Janet). Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help, and when Cassie says that she is trying to â€œdo something that matters,â€ her dad reminds her that he â€œliterally saved the world.â€ This comment receives fake shock from everyone else, who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before, and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it. Shrugging it off, the Avenger retorts, â€œYouâ€™re all welcome for all not being dust.â€;;
;;
"Voice over narration from Kang The Conqueror begins, """"You're an interesting man Scott Lang. You've lost a lot of time. But time isn't what you think. It's not a straight line."""" This dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device, which unexpectedly turns on. As it powers up, it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave, and Cassie gets sucked inside of it. As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her, he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast, landing them in the Quantum Realm. ";;
;;
"In montage footage, The characters wander through a trippy sci-fi landscape where they run into Bill Murray, who is wearing a kind of fantasy robe. He seems to recognize Janet van Dyne. We also get a glimpse of MODOK. Kangâ€™s voiceover continues, explaining that he knows how everything in Scottâ€™s life ends. Scott responds, â€œI donâ€™t know who you are, but youâ€™ve made a big mistake. Iâ€™m an Avenger.â€  The footage ends with Kang stepping out of the shadows, """"You're an Avenger? Have I killed you before?""""";;
;;
;;
"23:31 - *Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3* footage begins with Nebula piloting the ship as it is captured by Ravagers. She tells them to stand down as they have an appointment with Gamora, who is now leader of the Ravagers. Gamora appears, wearing all black and looking super tough. There's a shot of Peter Quill on his ship, looking sad. Peter reflects back on their time together. """"You were everything to me,"""" he said. """"I thought you were gone but you're here and I miss you."""" Gamora tells him that person was not her. ";;
;;
"In a montage set to """"Do You Realize"""" by Flaming Lips, we see the Guardians in colorful spacesuits, leaping into space, the evil monster from the beginning of the last film, Peter and the team getting off in what looks like an Earth neighborhood. Nebula is helping to put up a sign in what appears to be a business district with alien writing. There's a flashback to a baby version of Rocket Raccoon. We get a look at Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, who has gold skin, Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary, and Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog, played by Boratâ€™s Maria Bakalova. Groot fights back to back with Quill, now fully grown and even more bulky, muscular, and tall than in the original film. There is a shot of the team in their classic blue uniforms with red trimming from the comics. ";;
;;
The Guardians are bounding across an alien planet. Theyâ€™re each wearing brightly colored suits, each one different: blue, green, red, orange and yellow. Peter tries to talk to Gamora about their past. He asks if she might be willing to open herself up and she says â€œI donâ€™t think so, Quinn.â€ Peter corrects her â€œQuill. Itâ€™s Quill.â€ At which point Mantis tells Peter that theyâ€™re on an open channel and everyone can hear.  ;;
;;
The footage ends with the Guardians all walking in slow motion, Groot, thicker and more muscular, no Rocket, and Gamora slightly off in the background.;;

"16651,HFah22ClwMg,""The film is set in Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie (Phyllis Love) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child """"Little"""" Jess (Richard Eyer) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet goose causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh (Anthony Perkins) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm"; his children are still enslaved in the South.;
;;
"We are introduced to the family via its youngest member, """"Little"""" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday)"; contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.;
;;
The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer. On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.;;
;;
"When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a """"Reb"""". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence."",33.0,1.0";;

This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did. Sure, I wasn't dealing and stealing and whatnot. I was in all advanced classes and band.

As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle";" however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production.

"16927,X3paOmcrTjQ,""Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you donâ€™t figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned!

"17029,O9nf1CqjGzI,""Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well."",24.0,2.0";;

"17074,rqvyWUODZGE,""I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. ";;
;;
"I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for """"automation"""" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.";;
;;
For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.;;
;;
"Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree"",117.0,2.0";;
"17075,rqvyWUODZGE,""Personally I think you hit one key point: the importance of domain experts.  With the so-called automation or new technology/ tools we'll likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs.  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesn't mean he/she can do data science or machine learning -- or more importantly, to put out anything meaningful or even useful.  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.

"17133,71RVNeseKZw,""Hmmm I'm going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters. Is there any reason in particular that you would recommend CompSci beyond just the programming background it provides? Also, how different is data science compared to machine learning? They sound almost like the same thing (given their job descriptions). Great video btw!"",0.0,2.0";;
17134,oMn8zc5NlL4,Glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage. :),867.0,2.0;;
17135,oMn8zc5NlL4,I feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop. My two sister's worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up. Sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses. My sister's lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state. She then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze.  Actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times.,25.0,0.0;;
"17136,oMn8zc5NlL4,""so as a technician I worked at a dealership (two actually) owned by the same guy. He has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy. Like, he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands. To be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy."",142.0,2.0";;
"17137,oMn8zc5NlL4,""Since I was little I knew Iâ€™d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do. Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5% increase every year just sounds insane to me. I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them. Took countless 70+ hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup. Currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries Iâ€™m interested in.";;

"17139,oMn8zc5NlL4,""This actually makes a lot of sense. The company I work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealership/racing team owner.

17140,oMn8zc5NlL4,I'm a mortgage broker. He's completely right. Except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business.

"17141,oMn8zc5NlL4,""Depends also on what you define as rich. I don't mean that in a philosophical way either, just that living standards vary greatly from person to person. If you need to have a mansion, a yacht, and 5 or 6 super cars then it's a much greater challenge. Also, what are the time horizons? Is your goal to be """"rich"""" before you turn 30? Or can you wait until 45? or 50? Because something else they didn't mention in the video is investment, compounding interest, passive income, etc."",10.0,1.0";;
17142,oMn8zc5NlL4,Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.,304.0,2.0;;

Heâ€™s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as thatâ€™s what we love doing especially with public data thatâ€™s nice to play with. So the advice heâ€™s giving probably tends to bounce towards whatâ€™s most PROBABLE, not what will DEFINITELY make you rich. In most ways probability can you take you a long way."",5.0,2.0";;

;;
1) Study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you.;;
2) After you a role, study the JD for that role in various companies & check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role.;;
3) Go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role.;;
4) The coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn.  Studying the theoretical/ conceptual part first is suggested.;;
5) After the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data;;
6) Work on a project ( Kaggle is a great place to start);;

I've been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years, and have prototyped/concepted my own rpg 5 times. Only now in 2022, am i confident enough to build the official version.

The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.

When you start learning, if you go straight away to make your """"dream game"""", it will likely be frustrating, because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game. Creating a copy or a """"remake"""" of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn. When I started learning Unity, some years ago, after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a """"remake"""" of Duke Nukem 3D, using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender, this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project. It took me, I believe, 6 months to finish it, it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game, and yes, it played terrible and nothing like the original. But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot, I don't think I could have learned faster other way. Another point I would mention is: learning to code: I think was the most important thing I did. When I started making games my game ideas were limited to what I imagined I would be technically capable of implementing, after I got a good grasp of coding I feel and I know I could make anything I can imagine, given the time to do so."",208.0,1.0";

I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. ";;

-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic;;

 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better;;
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad;;

In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.";;

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.;

"17562,66SKA06jouw,""1:03:08 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines.";;
;;
Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines (which I love because they leave a large impact on the world!) But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often.;;
;;
That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future.;;
;;
There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts (or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development.) You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts.;;
;;
The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks.;;
;;
A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work... I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game. (I wouldn't have an issue with it but others may.);;
;;
Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldn't work when trying to make mineshafts I think.;;
;;
Edit: I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground.;;
;;
Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground... I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable.;;
;;

"17624,286SGzpUx9o,""Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things.

"17756,1mwNrMD0Lm0,""yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.";;
;;
"First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of """"wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this"""" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. ";;
;;
"So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print """"hello world"""", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.";;
;;
And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.;;
;;
"And last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break?

AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the 'biggest game'.

Except when you have games like Undertale, Minecraft (before Microsofts purchase) Goosegame, Goat Simulator, powerwash simulator, etc. Getting loads and loads of sales when they're developed by small teams. These games are very basic graphically, have a very short play time (minecraft an exception), no big budget, no fancy effects, no extraordinary acting. But just simple fun;;

I was unlucky that in my college years, you generally only had 1 option in IT. Which were basically programming for databases and networking. While I specifically went to learn coding and (graphics) designing to create games. I learned the graphics part on my own, also because I had a real knack and passion for it. Coding was more difficult, as information to code for gaming or even a game-engine, were hard to come by (or expensive).;;
Now, almost 2 decades further, our country finally is getting a gaming-industry and there are classes you can follow. I hope I can start in September and hopefully they're not too basic, as I already have some basics.;;
I already tried creating a game twice, sort of. First time was more than a decade ago, supposed to be a fighting game or beat'em up. I got my character modelled (not textured) and even rigged for facial animation. But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do. So much to consider and take into account. And there wasn't even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed.;;
Two years ago, I started again, but with another genre I liked and more manageable (for a single game dev),  an arcade racer. Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of (they also made it more user-friendly). And found a decent free game-engine: Godot. Atleast good enough to give me the taste of game-creation and create a tiny concept. I have some videos on my game-dev channel: 'Close Call Racing'on channel 'eyeEmotion'.;;

I don't have a portfolio since I am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you, and if you like it then we could look into working together.

"17918,ukzFI9rgwfU,""Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs";;
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data, it is supervised learning.;;
;;
;;
Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someoneâ€™s past music choices;;
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).;;
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.;;
;;
;;
Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious-looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions;;
"Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of """"fraud"""" and """"not fraud"""". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'."",1547.0,1.0";;

"18036,yN7ypxC7838,""I always find it interesting that the statement """"logistic regression is a classification method"""" is repeated so often, despite 'regression' being right there in the name.  Like decision trees (CART), random forest and other similar methods, there are both regression and classification versions of the method.  In a binary outcome problem, we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads (1) and 1-p of coming up tails (0).  We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression";" the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)"",27.0,1.0";

"18038,yN7ypxC7838,""It may surprise some people, but logistic REGRESSION is in fact a regression model. The output is continuous: it's a probability. Of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier. Just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output. So the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut."",7.0,1.0";;

The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one,  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it.

I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is, what it can do, hardware requierments and what gains it can provide, so  they can know if they really need it. Then, maybe, they should learn it in depth, but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements.;;

"18131,O5xeyoRL95U,""This lecture is awesome and really inspiring. I've been a fan now for years now Lex, and I'm really happy to see your success. I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of """"One Shot Learning"""" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim."",41.0,2.0";;

For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0.0,0.0;;

4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.;;

A. The Bias is added;;
D. The result is fed to an activation function;;
C. Specific Neuron is activated;;
;;
Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.;;

From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic. ;;
However, if you want to reach an even wider audience, considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English, I suggest:;;
1. To associate the subtitles, even if in English, as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery;;
2. That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way, as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language.;;

In software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers. Like for web development frontend technologies are same html, css, js. For backend one may choose a programming language (php, node js, asp.net) and a database. ;;
Again for mobile developers they may choose Android, IOS or cross platform (React native, flutter) with database knowledge, APIs & basic knowledge on how web works.;;

"18359,AO6urf07KjE,""I would also like to point out that actually *understanding* machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics (as was mentioned as a benefit, being part of something), will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability + statistics. In fact, at my university, in order to enrol in the first machine learning course, you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus (with proofs, as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops), one or two courses in linear algebra, and 2 courses in statistics. ";;
Thatâ€™s not to say itâ€™s impossible to use ML without that, of course it isnâ€™t. However, it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge (much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML). ;;
"So yes, you will be â€œa part of somethingâ€, in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with, but itâ€™s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level, or be generating their own custom models"",12.0,1.0";;
"18360,AO6urf07KjE,""In my eyes, the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml.

I'd keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the  code to see its performance not getting better at all."",23.0,0.0";;

"18363,AO6urf07KjE,""I'm taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book (not related to the course) and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting. The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didn't use python to do it, I was using Stata, but you could use R to do the same thing and now days I'm sure they are teaching python in economics. At any rate, even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful. Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing (including the textbook) all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesn't use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about? IDK.";;
;;
I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix, Google, Amazon or etc to help suggest something (or something along those lines). Well, that's all fine and good, but I don't work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill. The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and won't go into. Thus, kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term, and medium term. When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chart/graph with a line through it e.g. the trend line. Technically, you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML, so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating.  Or, other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age, salary, and whether or not they bought a car. You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes $70k will they buy a car? It will be based off a percentage, of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not.  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes. And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc. So, it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they don't really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects.     ;;
;;
Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predication/trend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using. They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset. This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they don't teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a small-medium business or say your website has x amount of traffic, etc.  ;;
;;
"I'm often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter. For example, in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression. Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 5-7 factors. But to be honest the housing sample is a great example, but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result (ie my own project). Also, the examples often are intuitive, like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I don't even need data or run ML on it to know that. It can get de-motiving at times. So, the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true. Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacation/travel during summer. Also, they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter. It's 200+ pages like that. Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying, """"Now, of course the real life data will not look anything like this, but you get the idea""""...    I am kind of stuck in-between smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want. I'm tempted to skip 20 hours or 200+ pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but can't stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section, or whatever.

"I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning """"tools for the sake of tools"""" and solving problems though. As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh"",5.0,2.0";;
"18402,cyLWtMSry58,""I come from a physics background, and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory, trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can. A lot of colleagues in my department don't understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop. During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity, which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects. Now that I'm finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want. Amazing content you put there, mate! Thanks from Brazil!"",5.0,2.0";;
"18403,cyLWtMSry58,""Back when I was learning to code I didnâ€™t know anything or what to do and how to do it. I asked a friend of mine how I could what books I should read etc. first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say â€œyou donâ€™t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks, you just need to know what is possibleâ€ and that really reasonated  with me because once you know what is possible, you can think of a problem and as the video states â€œlearn by doingâ€, my friend said to work Iâ€™m projects I want to solve or replicate and implement what I have learned that way. Rather than sitting around reading these books."",33.0,1.0";;
18404,cyLWtMSry58,I really like the point about engineering toolboxes. I think thatâ€™s where a lot of the burnout comes from. I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap. Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time.,0.0,2.0;;

"18408,cyLWtMSry58,""This is great. Focus is key. A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate. It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ."",0.0,2.0";;
